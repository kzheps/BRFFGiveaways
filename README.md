# B2T2 Theme
> Dekstop-App for [Bratishkinoff](https://twitch.tv/bratishkinoff/) by @kzheps

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/1.0.0-pdw?style=for-the-badge&logoColor=white&logoSize=amd&label=release&labelColor=black&color=gray)](https://shikimori.one/) 
[![Boosty](https://img.shields.io/badge/SUPPORT-pdw?style=for-the-badge&logo=boosty&logoColor=white&logoSize=amd&labelColor=black&color=orange&link=https%3A%2F%2Fboosty.to%2Fpdw)](https://boosty.to/pixelith)

The theme is written for general use, but first of all it is written for one anime lover, so the theme does not support the builder of its backgrounds or wallpapers. The theme works in multiple browsers, adapted for many devices. The theme has been redesigned in minimalistic concepts, fronted by multiple aspects of the site. THIS THEME IS NOT A PROFILE COVER.

## Install

Requires an exportable line of code to be inserted into the .css notepad window. 

Light Theme — @import url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Flykins/shikimori-galaxies/master/theme-light.css"); 
Dark Theme — @import url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Flykins/shikimori-galaxies/master/theme-dark.css");

## Gallery

> [!WARNING]
> The site is frequently updated in terms of new features and its design, bugs may occur in the theme, so it is highly recommended to keep an eye on theme updates.
